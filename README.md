this is a threadpool library highly inspired by https://github.com/rust-threadpool/rust-threadpool,
please check that out it's way better than my version this is only for low dependency and low compile time for 
my big project https://github.com/Kleinmarb/snapapi. It's just a stripped version (bader version) without the num_cpus 
dependency and the documentation and some code I don't need.
